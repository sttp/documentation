# Filter Expressions

Filter expressions in STTP are used to select desired signals for subscription or to reduce available meta-data down to a desired subset. Filtering syntax is similar to [Structured Query Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) (SQL), but does not implement the full SQL language.

Filter expressions operate against in-memory [data set](../data-sets), not a backend database. The filtering syntax used in conjunction with a data set is designed for read-only operations and exposes no update functionality. Because of this, filter operations are not subject to SQL injection attacks or other security concerns typically associated with SQL implementations.

STTP data publishers need to define a data set consisting of a collection of data tables representing the [primary meta-data](#primary-meta-data-table-definitions) from locally defined configurations that contain information about the time-series style data to be published. At a minimum this meta-data should define a [Guid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) based identifier for each [measurement](#measurementdetail) to be published as well as an associated source, i.e., a [device](#devicedetail), that produces the measurement.

> :information_source: The STTP data publisher API defines functions to help create needed meta-data, see [samples](https://github.com/sttp/cppapi/tree/master/src/samples) and [specific example](https://github.com/sttp/cppapi/blob/master/src/samples/InstancePublish/PublisherHandler.cpp#L72)

## Filtering Syntax
```sql
FILTER <TableName> [TOP n] WHERE <Expression> [ORDER BY <SortField> [ASC|DESC]]
```

Filter expressions in STTP are parsed using [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/). For complete syntax description, see full ANTLR grammar: **[FilterExpressionSyntax.g4](https://github.com/sttp/filter-expressions/blob/main/FilterExpressionSyntax.g4)**

### Available Options and Clauses

| Keyword | Example | Description | Required?|
|---------|---------|-------------|:----------:|
| FILTER | See [examples](#examples) below | Keyword that signifies a _filter_ expression follows* | Yes|
| TOP `n` | TOP 100 | Selects only the first `n` number of items | No|
| WHERE &lt;Expression&gt; | WHERE SignalType='FREQ' | Criteria based expression, in SQL syntax, used to filter rows | Yes |
| ORDER BY &lt;ColumnName&gt; | ORDER BY SignalType | Expression specifying column names and sort directions | No |

> :information_source: The keyword _FILTER_ is used instead of the standard SQL _SELECT_ keyword to reinforce the notion that the expression that follows is special purposed and not standard SQL.

### Direct Signal Identification

Filtering syntax also supports the direct specification of desired signals as semi-colon separated measurement references in a variety of forms, e.g., **measurement key identifiers**: _PPA:4; PPA:2_ - formatted as `{instance}:{id}`, unique **Guid-based signal identifiers**: _538A47B0-F10B-4143-9A0A-0DBC4FFEF1E8; '06d039f6-e5e9-4e37-85fc-52a125c67a06'; {E4BBFE6A-35BD-4E5B-92C9-11FF913E7877}_ optionally surrounded by single quotes or braces, or **point tag name identifiers**: _"GPA_TESTDEVICE:FREQ"; "GPA_TESTDEVICE:FLAG"_ where each point tag name is in double quotes.

### Examples

Example filter expression to select measurements with the company of `GPA` and type of Frequency `(FREQ)` or Voltage Magnitude `(VPHM)`:
```sql
    FILTER ActiveMeasurements WHERE Company='GPA' AND SignalType IN ('FREQ', 'VPHM') ORDER BY Device DESC
```

Example filter expression to select first 20 measurements of type Statistic `(STAT)`:
```sql
    FILTER TOP 20 ActiveMeasurements WHERE SignalType = 'STAT'
```

Example filter to only select Current Angle `(IPHA)` and Voltage Angle `(VPHA)` for Positive Sequence `(+)` measurements.
```sql
    FILTER ActiveMeasurements WHERE SignalType LILE '%PHA' AND Phase='+' ORDER BY PhasorID
```

Example filter combining both filter expressions and directly specified tags:

```sql
PPA:15; STAT:20; PPA:8; {eecbda2f-fe76-4504-b031-7f5518c7046c};
FILTER ActiveMeasurements WHERE SignalType IN ('IPHA', 'VPHA'); 9d0423c0-2349-4a38-85d5-b6e81735eb48;
FILTER TOP 3 ActiveMeasurements WHERE SignalType = 'FREQ' ORDER BY Device; "GPA_TESTDEVICE:FREQ"
```

### Filter Expression Operators

Any operators that consist of letters, e.g., `OR`, are not case sensitive, so `OR`, `or` and `Or` are all equivalent.

#### Unary Operators

| Type | Symbol |
| :--: | :----: |
| Negative | `-` |
| Positive | `+` |
| Not | `NOT` or `!` or `~` |

#### Comparison Operators

| Type | Symbol |
| :--: | :----: |
| Less Than | `<` |
| Less Than or Equal | `<=` |
| Greater Than | `>` |
| Greater Than or Equal | `>=` |
| Equal | `=` or `==` or [`===`](#case-sensitive-comparison-operators) |
| Not Equal | `!=` or `<>` or [`!==`](#case-sensitive-comparison-operators) |

#### Logical Operators

| Type | Symbol |
| :--: | :----: |
| And | `AND` or `&&` |
| Or | `OR` or `\|\|` |

#### Bitwise Operators

| Type | Symbol |
| :--: | :----: |

### Case Sensitive String Comparisons

Unless otherwise specified, comparison of string values in filter expressions is not case sensitive. To specify a case sensitive comparison, use one of the following expression options:

#### Case Sensitive `LIKE` Expression

```
FILTER <TableName> WHERE <ColumnName> [NOT] LIKE [===|BINARY] 'expression'
```
_Example:_
```
FILTER ActiveMeasurements WHERE Device LIKE BINARY 'SHELBY%'
```

#### Case Sensitive `IN` Expression

```
FILTER <TableName> WHERE expression [NOT] <ColumnName> IN [===|BINARY] (expression1, ..., expression_n )
```
_Example:_
```
FILTER ActiveMeasurements WHERE NOT SignalType IN ===('IPHM', 'VPHM')
```

#### Case Sensitive `ORDER BY` Expression

```
FILTER <TableName> WHERE expression ORDER BY [===|BINARY] <ColumnName> [ASC|DESC]
```
_Example:_
```
FILTER TOP 5 ActiveMeasurements ORDER BY Device, === PointTag DESC
```

#### Case Sensitive Comparison Operators

When expressions are strings, or evaluated as strings, the following operators perform a case sensitive compare:
```
expression1 === expression2   // Case sensitive equals comparison
expression1 !== expression2   // Case sensitive not equals comparison
```
_Example:_
```
FILTER ActiveMeasurements WHERE Device === 'SHELBY'
```

## Signal Selection Meta-data Table Definitions

Data publishers can define multiple tables that represent sets of measurements available for filtering desired signals, e.g., `AllMeasurements` or `LocalMeasurements`. At a minimum a signal selection table must define a `SignalD` field of type `Guid` - all other fields are considered optional. However, without a point tag name or description the measurement may be of little use unless other meta-data is exchanged out-of-band with STTP.

Signal selection tables should represent a simple flattened "_view_" of available meta-data with as many fields as needed to be useful for measurement selection operations. See usage of `ActiveMeasurements` in [examples](#examples).

### _ActiveMeasurements_

The `ActiveMeasurements` table is always expected to be defined. This table represents all measurements considered _active_ and _available_ for subscription. If a data publisher is controlling access to measurements on a per-subscriber basis, this table should only include the measurements the subscriber is allowed to request for subscription.

Typically the data in the `ActiveMeasurements` table is derived from the conflation of information already defined in other available meta-data condensed to a single table to make filter expressions more productive.

Common fields for the `ActiveMeasurements` table are defined below. Note that some of the fields are specific to the electric power industry and may not be applicable for other industry implementations and consequently unavailable.

> :information_source: The STTP data publisher API will automatically generate the `ActiveMeasurements` table when [primary meta-data tables](#primary-meta-data-table-definitions) are defined, see the [DefineMetadata](https://github.com/sttp/cppapi/blob/master/src/lib/transport/DataPublisher.h#L155) function.

## Primary Meta-data Table Definitions

STTP meta-data is designed around the notion of a [data set](https://github.com/sttp/cppapi/tree/master/src/lib/data). Meta-data represented by a data set allows for rich and extensible information description.

Outside the expected `ActiveMeasurements` signal selection meta-data table definition, no other meta-data tables are required to be defined. However, to make data exchange useful for industry specific STTP implementations, a common set of meta-data should be defined.

The STTP data publisher API currently defines three primary data tables to define enough useful meta-data to allow a measurement data subscription to be converted into another protocol, e.g., [IEEE C37.118](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/C37_118_1-2011.html). When these tables are defined, the data publisher API will auto-generate the `ActiveMeasurements` table from the provided data.

### _DeviceDetail_

This meta-data table contains details about the devices that are the sources of available measurements. By convention, [measurements](#measurementdetail) that are not associated with a device are not sent in meta-data exchanges.
